<p>Hey folks. Time flies and we're already into the third quarter of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Bad news first:</strong> Coronavirus cases are increasing rapidly in some states in the U.S., which indicates that there will be a drag on the economy due to business restrictions in those states, resulting in continued high rates of unemployment.</p>
<p>You can check on how your state is doing using the links below. For those of you outside the U.S., refer to your government's health ministry for the most updated information.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Overview: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases-50-states</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Cases &amp; Deaths: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/state-timeline/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rate of Positive Tests: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't have any hard data on which engineering industries are affected the most, so I recommend searching for recent discussions here and in r/AskEngineers.</p>
<p><strong>The good news:</strong> Read around long enough and you'll find some industries have been buffered from the economic impact of recent events. These are typically industries that have already had their contracts approved through FY 2020, i.e. defense and Medicare â€” which implies that defense contractors, spaceflight, national laboratories, and medical devices may ramp up hiring despite current economic conditions.</p>
<p>However, note that this is just my personal view of the situation and I don't have any evidence to back it up (aside from stuff everyone can access like BLS). Do your own homework and ask around before making any career decisions.</p>
<p>For broad macroeconomic updates I recommend visiting r/econmonitor. You'll mostly find stuff about monetary policy, but there's some insightful discussion on unemployment.</p>
