            How Automation Technology Affects Job Markets
          </h2>
        </header>
      <div class="content">
         <p>In late 2013, two Oxford academics released a paper claiming that <a href="http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf">47 percent of current American jobs</a> are at 'high risk' of being automated within the next 20 years. The findings provoked lots of worried news reports about robots stealing jobs. The study looked at 702 occupations, using data from the Department of Labor, and assigned a probability of automation to each one, according to nine variables.</p>
<p>Automation is a scary topic for a lot of people. The idea that our jobs might be replaced by a machine is an unsettling and very real possibility for many of us, but the conclusion that machines and robots are going to replace a vast number of existing jobs in such a way that no new jobs will be created is not supported by economic literature. There are very few economists who would support the proposition that humans will become partially or fully obsolete, resulting in large-scale structural unemployment.</p>
<h1>So what exactly is 'automation' ?</h1>
<p>Angus Deaton, who won the Nobel prize in economics last year, addresses this in his book <em>The Great Escape</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over most of the past century, Americans have been acquiring more education, so that the supply of skill to the labor market has increased. If nothing else had happened, this chain of events would have reduced the value of education and driven down the gap in wages between those with and without a college degree. Yet the gap has risen, not fallen, and it has done so particularly rapidly since the late 1970s. When price rises even though the supply has risen, we know that demand must be rising more rapidly. Economists attribute this rise to the relentless increase in the skills required to work with new information-based technologies. They believe that the acceleration in skill-biased technical progress over the past thirty years is the main engine driving increased inequality in earnings.</p>
<p>[…] The process will stop only when we have done everything that can be done with the new information technologies, and inventive attention will move on to some other part of the economy, just as it moved on from railways to automobiles and from automobiles to electronics. Rising wage inequality is a by-product of this mechanism and plays a key role in the raising of the supply of skills. So while inequality is not particularly welcome in its own right, it is part of a system that is raising living standards for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Automation is an extension of the <strong>Skill-Biased Technological Change (SBTC) hypothesis,</strong> which suggests that because the level of education and skill required to work in today's world of technology and the Internet is ever increasing, this inherently drives wage &amp; education inequality as the demand of getting a college degree and the premiums to do so keep going up. In general, SBTC represents manageable inequality changes; labor &amp; capital shares remain stable but there is a clear divergence between types of workers.</p>
<p>The Oxford paper you referenced from the NYT article is oft-cited, as it was the first to do a thorough review of the scale of labor disruption that may occur in the future as well as a more comprehensive discussion of the SBTC hypothesis. Interestingly, despite noting that it didn't consider productivity effects nor possible new labor demand resulting from productivity changes, it is frequently cited blindly with the claim that half of workers will be unemployed, as the New York Times has done. This is extraordinarily incorrect.</p>
<h1>What are the effects of automation?</h1>
<p>Prominent labor economist David Autor shows through his 2014 paper, <a href="http://economics.mit.edu/files/9835">Polanyi's Paradox and the Shape of Employment Growth</a>, what actually happens through "automation cycles", or periods where new automation technology is able to replace a significant amount of labor done by human workers. Autor is notable here as he has massively advanced our understanding of the interaction between technology and labor over the past couple of decades.</p>
<p>Autor shows that when a labor market is affected by new automation technologies, it causes the labor market to polarize. In other words, the jobs which are able to be completely replaced by automation decrease because it's cheaper to use the new technology, while jobs that are unaffected or complemented by the technology increase.</p>
<h2>To summarize Autor's key findings:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle-wage, middle education</strong> (high school / some college) jobs, such as administrative office work, sales, and manufacturing labor decrease through automation cycles.</li>
<li><strong>Low-wage, low education</strong> jobs with manual tasks, such as construction, preparing food, cutting hair, and so on - and high-wage, high education jobs that involve cognitive problem-solving tasks, such as engineering, software development, etc. increase through automation cycles.</li>
<li>Job polarization eventually ends once the automating technologies have penetrated the entire labor market where the technology has benefit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What happens to the people who lost their jobs due to automation?</h2>
<p>It turns out that they tend do one of three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Transition between jobs at their current skills &amp; education level (if there is demand for them).</li>
<li>Leave the labor market entirely to undergo training and/or education to acquire new skills to enter a different labor market.</li>
<li>A frequent third option in many developed countries, the U.S. especially, is a combination of the above where a person continues to work in low-to-middle wage jobs to afford the costs of training &amp; education.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I hinted earlier, Autor also finds that new automation technology doesn't always result in jobs being replaced. When a worker becomes more productive because of automation, Autor calls this complementarity - in other words, workers are complemented by technology rather than replaced by it, making them more productive.</p>
<p>A common example of this in software development is when someone writes a programming script to automate some routine tasks, freeing up more of his/her time to work on something else. CNC machines still need instructions from a machinist, construction equipment still needs skill and judgment from a human operator, and so on. Jobs that don't rely heavily on information processing technology for core tasks are effectively insulated from the substitution and complementary effects of automation.</p>
<hr>
<p>Beyond this there is a huge split between technologists and economists regarding what automation means in the future of labor, the recent <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2014/08/Future-of-AI-Robotics-and-Jobs.pdf">Pew expert survey</a> is a good example of this effect with economists concentrated on the disruption but not displacement side, and technologists on the displacement side. Perhaps economists are wrong, but the split certainly suggests either economists have a global misunderstanding or there are effects non-economists are not considering.</p>
<p>More generally, <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/robots/">economists argue</a> that historically automation has not reduced employment. Automation has historically acted as a multiplier on productivity which drives demand for human labor. Pre-singularity, it's very hard to imagine this changing, as we will undoubtedly encounter disruption effects - people will have the wrong skills, and their earnings will reflect this matching issue rather than unemployment doing so - but from an economics perspective there is little difference between replacing a field worker with a tractor and an office worker with an algorithm. Farmers in 1900 could not have foreseen the advent of job sectors like IT, healthcare, and finance.</p>
<p>Certainly the office worker needs to find a new job if they don't have demanded skills that job may not offer earnings growth opportunities, but it doesn't imply unemployment anymore then the mechanization of agriculture did. The second question in the linked IGM survey represents the SBTC split: while SBTC is reasonably well-supported, it lacks clear consensus - it isn't clear which of the two inequality scenarios will play out.</p>
